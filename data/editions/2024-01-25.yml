  title: "An introduction to FastAPI"
  speaker: helenalopes
  summary: |
    FastAPI is a recent Python web framework for building APIs that has been
    gaining a lot of popularity lately. It is based on open standards like
    OpenAPI or JSON Schema and supports asynchronous programming or Python type
    annotations. I hope to inspire you to use it, just as I was inspired by the
    FastAPI creator.
